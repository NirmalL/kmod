# kmod

A simple module for the linux kernel written in C, compatible with the book 'Operating System Concepts'

## Lab Instructions

Project 1

In this project  you will be developing kernel modules in a Linux system.

Assignment: Complete & submit the following assignments from Project 2 (Linux Kernel Module for listing tasks) in Chapter 3 of the textbook (Operating System Concepts).

Part I Assignment (page 160): Iterating over Tasks Linearly

Part II Assignment (page 161): Iterating over Tasks with a Depth-First Tree


Learning Material: The instructions/help needed to complete the project is in the textbook (Chapter 2 Programming Project (Linux Kernel Modules), pages 96 - 101, and Chapter 3 Project 2, pages 159 - 161).

NOTE: Please note that you are working with the Linux kernel, where an error could crash the entire system. Therefore, it is advisable to do these exercises in a virtual machine.

 Project 1 Submission Assignment
Submit the following for both parts of your project:

Source code of the kernel module
dmesg outputs after loading and removing the module (hint: you can output redirection to get the dmesg output to a file. e.g., $dmesg > dmesg_out_module_load.txt)
Outputs of ps -el and ps -eLf commands for part I and part II, respectively.
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 11:55pm on Saturday, 22nd August 2015

NOTE: You have been given longer duration for the project submission to account for any issues you will face. Don't wait until the last moment to start the project. I will NOT entertain any late submissions. Reminder: the project component accounts for 25% of the final grade
